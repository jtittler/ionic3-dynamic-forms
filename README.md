This is a project based on Ionic 3 [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/).

## Dynamic Forms and Components

This is the sample project for generating dynamic forms and dynamic components I'm developing. In this stripped down sample, I'm just creating one dynamic form with one dynamically created <ion-input type='textbox'>. For some reason, I cannot click in the control to be able to edit the control's contents. There is some disconnect between Angular and Ionic which I am missing. Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
